  <h1>Welcome to the Product List App!</h1>
  <p>This is a React-based web application that displays a list of products retrieved from a remote API. The application has two main pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Product List page: displays a list of all products, along with their name, image, and price. The list is paginated, allowing the user to navigate through the products using a set of page links. The user can also search for products by entering a search term in the search box at the top of the page.</li>
    <li>The Product Detail page: displays detailed information about a single product, including its name, image, price, and description. This page is accessed by clicking on a product from the Product List page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The application is built using React, and uses the React Router library for handling page routing. The product data is retrieved from a dummy API using the fetch() function, and is rendered using a set of React components. The application also makes use of several hooks, including useState() and useEffect().</p>
